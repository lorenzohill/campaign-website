        <h2>Colby Connerly Announces Run for Longview City Council Pos. 2</h2>
        <h3 class="date">January 24, 2023</h3>
        <p>Longview, WA - Today, Colby Conerly made the following statement:</p>
        <p>
          Today I am proud to announce that I am putting my name forward to be one of your next Longview city councilors. I want to make the following clear: I am not compelled to run by the pursuit of power. I am compelled to run to free my neighbors of those who do. Our current City Council undertakes a noble cause of fighting homelessness but in doing so empowers a homeless industrial complex. Meanwhile, they continue to increase the financial burden on working-class families with more taxes while we are in a recession.
        </p>
        <p>
          
        For the majority of you who don't yet know me. I grew up in a working-class family, and I have seen what an economic crisis can do to one. My family did not have much but they taught me three essential skills: work ethic, respect, and intuition. Values that council members have lacked these past few years. I have always been one to take bold leaps and never shy from work. College was out of reach for my family so I went to work in retail stores, warehouses, and even a seafood processing plant to pay rent. All the while learning about visual art through independent study. I have since gone on to work as a graphic designer and organizer for several campaigns across the country. It was during this that I realized that local leadership was just as lacking as it is at the national level. Of the 10,000+ doors I knocked on in southwest Washington over the course of 2022 many told me their most pressing issues were at the local level. That's what convinced me to run.</p>
        <p>
        My campaign will be focused on mending the divides caused by poor leadership. To listen to those who are struggling silently among us. The working-class families and small businesses who barely make enough to get by. I set out to create a coalition of reason and respect for all citizens of Longview. Our city already has good foundations. It's time that we build upon them. I look forward to getting to know you all. There will be more to come in the following weeks.</p>
